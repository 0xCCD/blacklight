Blacklight v2.4.1, 12-11-2009

NOTABLE CHANGES:

	- template installer now puts "require" (instead of require_dependency) into your application_controller and application_helper files. This seems to fix a bug related to reloading code in development mode.
	
	- Blacklight::SolrHelper #get_search_results and #get_solr_response_for_doc_id methods now return an array where the first object is a solr response hash and the second is a SolrDocument instance or array of SolrDocuments, thanks to Jonathan Rochkind.
	
	- bug fixed where template installer would continue to add the same lines to application_controller and application_helper if the template was executed more than once.
	
	- Changed development solr port to 8983
	
	- New rake task for copying core assets into application: rake blacklight:copy_assets
	
	- New view helper methods implemented by Jonathan Rochkind: render_stylesheet_links, render_js_includes, and render_document_heading
	
	- Removed EAD implementation, considering new approach.
	
	- JRuby support and JRuby gem specs. Bill Dueber created a great write up on running Blacklight under JRuby: http://robotlibrarian.billdueber.com/running-blacklight-under-jruby/

35dc3e3 new get_search_results return values. This file doesn't currently actually contain any tests, but changed before(:each) so it should work when it does.
dacbe0f new return values of get_search_results. @document_list ivar is set for partial.  @doc is set to @document_list.first, so tests are run against SolrDocument not a Mash.
ca87858 SolrHelper spec changed to use new return values of @solr_helper.get_search_results.  New spec added to make sure @document_list contents match @response.docs contents. Specs that tested for size of @response.docs now also test to make sure @document_list is the same size.
16f1953 document list iterates through @document_list ivar instead of @response.docs, so it's iterating through actual SolrDocuments
